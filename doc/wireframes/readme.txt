Because the focal point of our website is an interface that allows the user to
make a soccer team our layout is fairly unique. The 11 FIFA cards in the center 
of the webpage is the team the user is building. Our wireframes show empty cards, 
before the user has added any actual players. The left side of the webpage shows 
the stats (overall rating, chemistry, etc.) of the current squad. While in sandbar mode, 
The user can use the right side of the webpage to browse through potential players to add to 
their squad. There are a number of filters such as country, league, and club for 
the user to use if desired. While in draft mode, the user will be presented with 
various options for each position. These will be mostly randomly selected players
from our players database. These will be the only two main UI's on our website.
